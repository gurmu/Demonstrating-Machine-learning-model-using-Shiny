# Demonstrating-Machine-learning-model-using-Shiny

Shiny play a very crucial roles when it comes to visualizing your machine learning model to stackholders. In this lesson, we will build a regularized logistic regression that predicts whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). Next, we will save the model and build a shiny app and test the app by uploading test data. Finally, we will download the data we uploaded with predictions using the machine learning model we built below. The data is from the famous Machine Learning Coursera Course by Andrew Ng.

Lesson Goals
Shiny play a very crucial roles when it comes to visualizing your machine learning model to stackholders. In this notebook, we will build a regularized logistic regression that predicts whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two diffeerent tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. Next, we will save the model and build a shiny app and test the app by uploading test data. Finally, we will download the data we uploaded with predictions using the machine learning model we built below. The data is from the famous Machine Learning Coursera Course by Andrew Ng.
